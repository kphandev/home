					<h2 id = "welcome"> -> ABOUT ME <- </h2>
					<br>
				I'm Kevin Phan, an aspiring software developer. For many years, I worked as a research coordinator, honing my research, analytical, and critical thinking skills. What I enjoyed most about my work was the complex problem solving. 
				<br>
				<br>
					Although most of my work experience is in the research field, I hope to be a crucial member of any information technology team.

					<h2 id = "welcome"> -> WHY SOFTWARE <- </h2>
						For as long as I could remember, technology was my passion. I am deeply engrossed in thinking -how can we make this better- and imagining ways to make things more efficient. <br><br>
						Software always seemed like something out of my reach...until I tried it. I was frustrated at first but the reward of finally cracking the code had me coming back again and again. So here I am, trying to make it my career.
