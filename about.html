I began college wanting to become an engineer but became fascinated by biological studies. My friends were doing it, the careers were hyped, it was all the rage! And so, I set off on my journey as a healthcare professional. </p>

                <p class = "lefty"><strong>UNIVERSITY CHP. II</strong> <br> There was a stage in my college career where I balanced classes, worked 2 jobs, and volunteered. It was tough, I wanted to give up, but even through the struggle, it felt rewarding. This was a time where I really developed my work ethics, my philosophies, and marketability--I was ready for a 'real' job!

                After hundreds of applications in healthcare, I was often left a few crumbs that led to nothing... 
                I was competing against candidates with Master's degrees, I contemplated graduate school, maybe I could be a pro-gamer? That's when I learned to code...

                Coding became the new hotness for me. It is something I find myself enjoyably dumping hours into to. I took online courses, I attended a bootcamp--and I even got job offers! I started off studying QA automation but I knew I wanted to become developer.
