      <h1> ABOUT ME: </h1>
      I'm a young, aspiring software engineer. Most of my college career was focused on healthcare but I found drive and passion working in software and web development! The team-oriented work and problem solving aspect of the industry keeps me engaged and excited to tackle new problems with efficient and effective solutions! 
      <br><br>
      Below are a few humorous trilogies that follow the major events in life, from university to a projected ambitious future. I hope you enjoy!

   <img class = "blockpic" src="https://github.com/kphanplan/home/blob/master/pics/hischool.JPG?raw=true">

    <p class = "lefty"><strong>HIGH SCHOOL</strong> <br> High School, the awkward stage in life where we start to wonder 'who do I want to be'. I wanted to be an engineer. In fact, the highlights of my time in adolescent purgatory were spent in Engineering--building robots, trebuchets, and questionable pyrotechnics. </p>
    </div>


    <div class = "col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">
    <img class = "blockpic" src="https://github.com/kphanplan/home/blob/master/pics/univpt1.JPG?raw=true">

    <p class = "lefty"><strong>UNIVERSITY CHP.  I</strong> <br> College, 'who do I want to be' part 2. I began college wanting to become an engineer but became fascinated by biological studies. My friends were doing it, the careers were hyped, it was all the rage! And so, I set off on my journey as a healthcare professional. </p> 
  </div>

      <img class = "blockpic" src="https://github.com/kphanplan/home/blob/master/pics/univpt2.JPG?raw=true">

      <p class = "lefty"><strong>UNIVERSITY CHP. II</strong> <br> There was a stage in my college career where I balanced classes, worked 2 jobs, and volunteered. It was tough, I wanted to give up, but even through the struggle, it felt rewarding. This was a time where I really developed my work ethics, my philosophies, and marketability--I was ready for a 'real' job!

      <p class = "lefty"><strong>GRADUATION </strong> <br> Celebrate good times! My grueling trek through university had finally come to an end. I proceeded to use my final summer vacation as efficiently as possible: travelling, working part-time, and goofing off with friends. With my resume and experience, I'd get a job in no time...besides, how hard could it be?

  <div class = "col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">
    <img class = blockpic src="https://github.com/kphanplan/home/blob/master/pics/jobhunt1.JPG?raw=true">
    <p class = "lefty"><strong>JOB HUNT CHP. I</strong> <br> Turns out, finding a job right out of college is difficult.
    After hundreds of applications in healthcare, I was often left a few crumbs that led to nothing... 
    I was competing against candidates with Master's degrees, I contemplated graduate school, maybe I could be a pro-gamer? That's when I learned to code...

      <p class = "lefty"><strong>JOB HUNT CHP. II</strong> <br> 
      Coding became the new hotness for me. It is something I find myself enjoyably dumping hours into to. I took online courses, I attended a bootcamp--and I even got job offers! I started off studying QA automation but I knew I wanted to become developer.

    <p class = "lefty"><strong>THE MID-LEVEL</strong> <br> Years down the road, I'm a jaded programmer--I've seen it all! Crashed repositories, office drama, multi-language frameworks only a polyglot could decipher...I've learned everything from .NET to Python and beyond... </p>

    <p class = "lefty"><strong>THE SENIOR LEVEL</strong> <br> It's been decades since I've first become a developer. It's the year 2050 and I'm the greatest developer to ever exist. I never would've gotten here if it weren't for ______ Inc.! Wow!
