In fact, the highlights of my time in adolescent purgatory were spent in Engineering--building robots, trebuchets, and questionable pyrotechnics. </p>

I began college wanting to become an engineer but became fascinated by biological studies. My friends were doing it, the careers were hyped, it was all the rage! And so, I set off on my journey as a healthcare professional. </p>

                <p class = "lefty"><strong>University Pt.2</strong> <br> There was a stage in my college career where I balanced classes, working 2 jobs, and volunteering. It was tough, I wanted to give up, but even through the struggle, it felt rewarding. This was a time where I really developed my work ethics, my philosophies, and marketability--I was ready for that big-boy job!

I proceeded to use my last summer vacation as efficiently as possible: travelling, working part-time, and goofing off with friends. With my resume and experience, I'd get a job in no time...besides, how hard could it be? </p>
